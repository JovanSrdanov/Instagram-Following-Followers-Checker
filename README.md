# Instagram Following-Followers Checker

This script allows you to compare sets of followers and following on Instagram to gain insights into your account activity. Please follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are on a desktop device and logged into your Instagram account.
2. Navigate to your Instagram page.
3. Open the browser console. You can do this by right-clicking on the page, selecting "Inspect," and then navigating to the "Console" tab.
4. Copy and paste the provided script from the `check.js` file into the console.
5. Fill in the quotation marks within the script with your Instagram account name.

After executing the script, it will fetch data and perform the following comparisons:

- Who follows you
- Who you follow
- Users who follow you but you do not follow them
- Users you follow but who don't follow you
- The timestamp of the last check

The script stores the data in local storage, enabling it to compare new data with the previously stored information. This functionality allows you to identify users who may have unfollowed you, changed their account name, or potentially blocked you.
